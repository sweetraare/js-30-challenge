      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 100;
      console.log({ person, captain });

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain200 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 200 });
      console.log(
        { person, captain, captain200 },
        "be carefull it will only go 1 lvl deep"
      );

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const captainSpread = { ...person };
      captainSpread.name = "Captain Spred";
      console.log({ captainSpread, person }, 'Now we have it');

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
